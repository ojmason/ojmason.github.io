      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading Graham Lee’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007RNK0W6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B007RNK0W6&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=phrasysnlp-21&#34;&gt;Test-Driven iOS Development&lt;/a&gt;; (disclaimer:

software developing. Whenever I create a new class I write a bunch
of tests exercising the class’ properties. One might question the
value of this, because there is not really any reason why those
should not work. However, having such a test in place just uncovered
an as-yet unnoticed bug I introduced in a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally the class property in question was going to be set in
the &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; method, so I tested for the presence of the property
after creating an instance of the relevant class. Easy pass. Weeks
later I did something (and forgot to run the test suite). Today I
did something else, and this time I did run them. Hey presto, failed
test. And completely unexpected, because it was the property
exercising one. How on Earth did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon closer inspection I tracked it down to a refactoring, where I
extracted some code from &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; as there were now multiple ways an
object could be initialised. The failing code was part of that, and
I realised that it was called from the new &lt;code&gt;initFromFile:&lt;/code&gt; method,
but &lt;em&gt;no longer from the default initialiser&lt;/em&gt;. Easy mistake to make.
And had I run my test-suite more consistently, my application would
not have been with a potential bug in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I take home from this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even Mickey-Mouse-tests are valuable. No test is too small to be useful
(provided it’s actually testing something valid).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The test-suite should really be run after every change. I’ll have to check
if I can get Xcode to run them automatically after each compilation…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: Since I stopped doing much iOS or Mac OS work, I no longer used Xcode.
And I&amp;rsquo;m not missing it :)&lt;/p&gt;
