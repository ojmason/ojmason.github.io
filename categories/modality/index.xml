      <title>Sentence Disambiguation -- Modality to the Rescue!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m currently reading a new book on iPhone development, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1430224037?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=phrasysnlp-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1430224037&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone
Advanced Projects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 by Apress. I will probably talk about that book
in a later post, but today I will just focus on one sentence I came
across on page 212:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also adore the capability that I have to flag articles from folks I follow on Twitter and save them to Instapaper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sentence has (at least) two readings, which are probably only
obvious to a linguist (and who else would care?); I highlight the
differences by adding commas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I adore the capability, that I have to flag articles…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I adore the capability that I have, to flag articles…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first case you adore the capability. And the capability is
that you have to do something (flag articles). Sounds rather odd,
doesn’t it? The second case is more clear-cut and easy to understand:
you can flag articles, and that’s the capability you have and adore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in terms of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_grammar&#34;&gt;pattern grammar&lt;/a&gt;,
you’re either looking at &lt;em&gt;N that&lt;/em&gt; or
&lt;em&gt;N &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;-inf&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;capability&lt;/em&gt;. If you consult the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1424008255?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=phrasysnlp-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1424008255&#34;&gt;Cobuild Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;,
you’ll find that &lt;em&gt;capability&lt;/em&gt; only occurs with the second pattern,
the &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;-infinitive, so that you can rule out the first reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility would be to look at it in terms of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_modal_auxiliary_verb&#34;&gt;modality&lt;/a&gt;:
here we could argue that &lt;em&gt;capability&lt;/em&gt; prospects a modality of ability,
but &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; expresses obligation; the two don’t go together. Hence
the first reading sounds odd, as a capability does not usually force
you to do anything, but rather enables you. It could, however, be
used to signal sarcasm or irony, as in (the obviously made up) &lt;em&gt;I
really like that my new computer gives me the capability to have
to save my work every five minutes&lt;/em&gt;. This is clearly an odd sentence,
suggesting that modality works along similar lines as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_prosody&#34;&gt;discourse
prosody&lt;/a&gt; as described by Louw (1993) [for the full reference follow
the previous link].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have discussed two ways of disambiguating a sentence, one
based on grammatical properties (or typical environments), and one
on a non-syntactic phenomenon (modality). Pattern grammar allows
us to identify what the typical usage would be, whereas modality
explains to us why the first reading is at odds with the corresponding
words. Now all we need is a ‘pattern grammar’ for modality!&lt;/p&gt;
