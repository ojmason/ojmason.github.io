      <title>Constitutional Failure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside that Brexit is a political disaster in itself, the way the UK got into it
shows a deeper failure of the political system: a lack of resilience to catastrophic events.
The term &amp;ldquo;catastrophic&amp;rdquo; is here meant in the sense of &amp;ldquo;some event that causes enormous change
(usually bad)&amp;ldquo;, though in my view Brexit is a catastrophe in the other, main sense as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constitutional system should protect the state from radical change. The Weimar Republic failed,
as its constitution was not able to prevent the rise of fascism and its own abolition by an elected
government. The current German constitution requires a much bigger majority for any changes to the constitution
itself as a consequence: no more simple majorities that can empower a dictatorship as happened in 1933.
And the current chancellor cannot be voted out unless another candidate has a majority, another lesson
learned from 1933, where the democratic centre got squeezed from the extreme left and right wings, robbing
it of a majority without providing a positive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American system is currently being tested on the powers of the president. It was fine for the president
to make decisions by decree against the majority in the elected chambers as long as it was the good guy Obama;
but now Trump is in power, he can use the same powers to do things we don&amp;rsquo;t like. As Dan Carlin says in his
&lt;em&gt;Common Sense&lt;/em&gt; podcast, you want to be careful with who gets the power in case the people in charge change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British system failed, as a purely advisory referendum which arguably had no real majority in the population
and was called for no particular reason apart from appeasing a backbench group in a political party suddenly
became taken for granted, with enormous consequences for the economy and the political system of the country.
Regardless how it pans out, it will have caused great damage to the economy and the political status of the UK,
and will have wasted huge amounts of civil servants&amp;rsquo; time in trying to deal with re-writing four decades of laws
and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the UK had a functioning constitution, a decision of this enormity could not happen with a majority of just 1.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Party Politics and the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes</title>
      <link>https://ojmason.github.io/blog/party-politics-and-the-emperors-new-clothes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Twitter I came across a link to the (German) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cdu.de/sites/default/files/media/dokumente/regierungsprogramm-in-leichter-sprache-btw13.pdf&#34;&gt;CDU Wahlprogramm in “Leichter Sprache”&lt;/a&gt;.
This is the conservative party’s election manifesto in a German
version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English&#34;&gt;Basic English&lt;/a&gt;,
to make it more easily comprehensible to
people who have difficulty understanding standard German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I thought it was a parody, as it sounded truly ridiculous
and patronising. As if you had to explain to your 4-year-old what
the world was like. Then I found out about the “&lt;a href=&#34;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leichte_Sprache&#34;&gt;Leichte Sprache&lt;/a&gt;”
(literally: “&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_language&#34;&gt;easy/plain language&lt;/a&gt;“), which I had not heard of before.
And in principle it is a noble thing to do, to make your manifesto
more accessible. I’m sure &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm&#34;&gt;George Orwell&lt;/a&gt; would approve!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real reason why it does seem strange is rooted in the nature
of political language: normally, language is used to obfuscate and
manipulate, especially in complex areas such as politics. Fancy
words are used to disguise true intentions and get people to vote
for you. But take away the fancy words and complex phrases, and
suddenly all is out there in the open, plain to see for everybody.
And it turns out to be pretty meaningless. “Everybody should have
a good job. And earn enough money. That needs to be written down.”
But no mention about minimum wage or anything concrete to turn those
vacuous phrases into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other people on twitter reacted in the same way as I did; often
I guess out of the same ignorance of the “easy language” concept.
That’s a shame, but partly rooted in the patronising way the sentences
come across. But it also shows that the (undesired) outcome of this
publication is that people tend to not take the content seriously.
Because there is not much of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_discourse_analysis&#34;&gt;Critical Discourse Analysis&lt;/a&gt;
would lose a big part of its subject
area if politics would switch wholesale to “easy language”. No more
subconscious manipulation between the lines, no more obfuscation
about who does what to whom. So after some reflection I applaud the
CDU for making their manifesto available in this way, as it unmasks
them as the patronising right-wingers they are, with their overly
simplistic world view about pretty much any subject area in current
politics. No more hiding behind fancy words that foreigners are not
welcome. No more vague claims about surveillance cameras stopping
crime. It’s all there, in plain language. And other parties seem
to have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the only thing that needs to go is the disclaimer at the
beginning: that this plain version is not the real manifesto, and
only the real one does count. I would prefer it to be the other way
round.&lt;/p&gt;
