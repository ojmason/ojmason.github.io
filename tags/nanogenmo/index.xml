      <title>National Novel Generation Month -- Day 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a basic (abstract) plot outline and some idea about the characters&amp;rsquo; emotions,
I need to think about what drives them. &lt;a href=&#34;nanogenmo-2.html&#34;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I listed some aims that
the system would understand. So, each character gets a set of initial aims that they are trying to
achieve. Ideally there would be some conflict built in, for example a love interest: two separate
characters want to fall in love with the same person. As they attempt to win that person&amp;rsquo;s heart,
they might clash. Or, decide to live in an open relationship together as a triple, who knows!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would also make it easy to implement some of &lt;a href=&#34;nanogenmo-1.html&#34;&gt;Propp&amp;rsquo;s functions&lt;/a&gt;: the
&lt;em&gt;interdiction&lt;/em&gt; would mean that the hero is told one of his aims is not allowed. And the &lt;em&gt;interdiction-violation&lt;/em&gt;
would mean that the hero ignores that, and keep it as an aim. Alternatively, a friend&amp;rsquo;s aim could be disallowed,
and the hero would try to achieve the aim for the friend, such as acquire an object and give it to the friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step then is to annotate the narrative functions with actions and aims; for example, &lt;em&gt;absentation&lt;/em&gt;
could be an &lt;em&gt;atrans&lt;/em&gt; of a friend to a location as an action, and the same for the hero as an aim, as the hero
wants to be with their friend. There might be some conflicting aim (such as staying at home, protecting the
family), but the resolution might be that the friend starts feeling sad when away from their home environment,
leading to the aim of coming back home, which then achieves the hero&amp;rsquo;s aim as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also need to start thinking about the &lt;em&gt;World Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, the engine that does all the heavy lifting of
producing the story content. The original idea is to take &lt;em&gt;TaleSpin&lt;/em&gt;, but that might be a bit too simplistic.
After all, it&amp;rsquo;s only really been used for short stories about Joe Bear and Irving Bird. In addition I need
timestamping to keep track of where the various characters are and what they are doing, and a more sophisticated
logging facility, as the simulator log will be fed into the story renderer at the end. I also need to work
with multiple characters at once, so the whole setup needs to be a bit more capable than the original.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>National Novel Generation Month -- Day 2</title>
      <link>https://ojmason.github.io/blog/national-novel-generation-month----day-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was more of a research day, apart from some refactoring of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s work. Spent ages trying
to track down an error, which turned out to be one missing level of brackets in a data file. Oh well,
at least I&amp;rsquo;m getting used to debugging Scheme code now (I&amp;rsquo;m using guile to develop this system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To turn the basic plot into a story, I need to turn the Proppian functions into actions. So I&amp;rsquo;m thinking
of a way of annotating them with what essentially happens in each function. This can be a conceptual
dependency-style structure, but possibly also using some higher level commands than just the basic
primitives that Schank et al used in their work. These would later be expanded into such primitives to
be fed into the language generator at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also compiled an initial list of &lt;em&gt;aims&lt;/em&gt;, which will drive what the characters will be doing. These
are for example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go to location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go to person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acquire object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deliver object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acquire information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;defeat person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;destroy object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Propp function &lt;em&gt;departure&lt;/em&gt; maps onto giving the hero the aim &lt;em&gt;go to location&lt;/em&gt;. What that location is,
remains to be seen. It could be the location where a person or object can be found. Whereas &lt;em&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/em&gt;
gives the villain the aim &lt;em&gt;acquire information&lt;/em&gt;. There will be different ways to achieve these aims, which
will involve sub-aims, and hopefully enough variation to generate plenty of different stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about characters, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at emotions. Emotions will determine how characters react, though
I have as yet no clue how that would work. I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a scheme by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik&#34;&gt;Robert Plutchik&lt;/a&gt;, which uses eight basic emotions, where two
are paired as counterparts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust - Disgust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear - Anger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sadness - Joy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprise - Anticipation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be a scale (-10 to +10 or so), so an emotion item would be a list of four numbers. A character
will have a basic emotional state, but would also have emotion items describing the relationship with other characters.
The states are variable, so if character A is angry, and meets character B, towards whome they feel joy, then they
might become less angry. Obviously a very simplistic way to model something as complicated as human emotions,
but the perfect is the enemy of the good. Especially if you only have one month!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>National Novel Generation Month -- Day 1</title>
      <link>https://ojmason.github.io/blog/national-novel-generation-month----day-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2017 22:29:36 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have this year finally managed to have a go at NaNoGenMo, the attempt to write code to generate a novel, in analogy
to NaNoWriMo, where people try to actually write a novel themselves (which sounds like rather a lot of hard
work). Instead, I will instruct the computer to do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approach will consist of various stages, and at the top level I am planning to generate a broad and abstract
sequence of events that will be fleshed out in subsequent stages. I have chosen the framework of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Propp&#34;&gt;Vladimir Propp&lt;/a&gt;, who analysed Russian folk tales and came up with
a list of 31 &lt;em&gt;narrative functions&lt;/em&gt;, which can be grouped into four distinct sections. I&amp;rsquo;m generating a list of
sections, where each section can have up to four functions, and then I pick the appropriate number of functions
randomly from the list of functions for each section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some constraints, so you cannot have a &lt;em&gt;return&lt;/em&gt; unless you also had a &lt;em&gt;departure&lt;/em&gt; beforehand. I have
implemented a very simple routine which churns out sequences that fulfil their constraints. Quite primitive at
the moment, but perhaps a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some example outputs (for their meaning see the Wikipedia link above) are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(complicity trickery departure departure villany first-donor-func hero-reaction wedding pursuit)&lt;br /&gt;
This is a bit weird, as there are two departures (but they could be different people), and after
the &lt;em&gt;wedding&lt;/em&gt; there is a &lt;em&gt;pursuit&lt;/em&gt;, so the hero is chased away by a villain after he got married
and rewarded/promoted. Strange, but perhaps leading to an interesting story!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(interdiction trickery interdiction trickery departure departure departure first-donor-func struggle struggle transfiguration difficult-task)&lt;br /&gt;
Here the hero gets a warning/command twice, and each time a villain attempts some deception. This time,
&lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; people leave (I think that needs to be cut down to single occurrence only!) and a lot of fighting
is happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is, I can imagine writing a story around those functions. The
challenge is to see if the computer can do that, too. Still early
days.  The main concern with this whole thing is that the generated
novel will either be trivial and boring, or non-sensical and
incoherent. Probably even both. I am under no illusions that the final result will be worthwhile
reading; but I will only find out at the end!&lt;/p&gt;
