    <p><em>Update:</em> I originally posted this article in May 2008, but it is still relevant. I have kind of
found a solution that I&rsquo;m trying out now, namely moving to a fairly minimalist language, Scheme.
It is well suited to the main area I work in (NLP/AI), can be used purely functionally, and has
such a simple syntax that it should be relatively easy to write run-times for it on various platforms
if necessary.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the need for using different platforms has become less pressing for me, as
I mainly do this as a work-related hobby nowadays.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’m having a problem with languages. Not that there is something I
cannot do in my favourite language, but rather that there are
distinct ecosystems for various languages, and they are usually
fairly exclusive. For example, in order to program in a web context
you need either PHP, or alternatively be prepared to run your own
server if you want to use Java or Erlang. I’m not talking about
businesses or commercial operations here, just the private/academic/small
scale non-funded project range.</p>

<p>Most of the language processing software I’ve written is in Java,
because it works well and can run almost everywhere (but not on
shared webhosts). It’s useful to distribute applications, as people
can use it on Linux, Macs and even Windows. But I’ve now pretty
much switched to Erlang, as I put high hopes on the future of
parallel programming, and I want my software to take advantage of
multi-core processors. However, Erlang programs are not as easily
shared and distributed as Java apps are. Problem.</p>

<p>Ideally I’d like to write all my programs only once. This was kind
of the promise of Java, and it worked mostly. At some point I even
considered working on an interpreter for JVM bytecode written in
PHP (so that my Java classes would work without having to be re-coded
in PHP itself), but aside from the possibly terrible performance
it seemed too daunting a project. Maybe Erlang could be compiled
into JVM bytecodes? Of course you’d lose all the concurrency features
etc, but at least you could deploy it together with a Java app. A
bit like Scala, almost. <em>Update:</em> There is a (defunct?) project
that does attempt exactly that: <a href="https://github.com/trifork/erjang">Erlang on the JVM</a>.</p>

<p>If PHP wasn’t such a ghastly language I’d be happy to code everything
in that, but it seems too much of a sacrifice. But for most purposes
I would need at least those three:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java for applications to be deployed to other people</li>
<li>PHP for stuff running on shared webservers</li>
<li>Erlang for research and cutting-edge stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>And there is little to no common ground between them. Sigh.</p>
