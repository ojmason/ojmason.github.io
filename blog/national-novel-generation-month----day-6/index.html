    <p>Day 6 &ndash; but today is November 24th&hellip; this just serves to show how hard it is to combine a side project
with a full-time job, a family, and other hobbies! The last two weekends I spent sailing at two all-weekend
races (Northampton and Draycote), and in the evenings I am generally too busy with other things. And I don&rsquo;t
want to &lsquo;pull an all-nighter&rsquo;, as it&rsquo;s not a sustainable way to do things. However, today I got a few things
done:</p>

<p>The central element of my project is a &lsquo;world simulator&rsquo;, in which the characters act out their desires, follow
their goals, and interact in (hopefully) interesting ways, which I will then harvest to generate a story from.
The core of the simulator is a planner: you feed in the characters&rsquo; goals, and they will then find a way of
doing what they need to do in order to achieve them. The planning algorithm I&rsquo;m using is called Goal Oriented
Action Planning (GOAP), basically a back-ward chaining algorithm: Starting from the goal, you work backwards
to see which actions get you to your goal. Each action has a post-condition (which would be matched to the
goal), and a pre-condition (which becomes the new goal). You select an action whose post-condition matches
some of the character&rsquo;s goal conditions, and then see how you get there. Each action also has a cost associated
with it, which allows you to choose a more efficient path in case there are several options.</p>

<p>I have today managed to implement a very basic version of that in Scheme. I&rsquo;m using atomic conditions, but
eventually will have more complicated expressions, but it is a first step. For several toy scenarioes the
planner does indeed find suitable solutions, which are paths through a network of states. Adjusting this to
the final world representation should not be too much of an issue.</p>

<p>I have resigned myself to not finishing this system by the end of the month. But I&rsquo;ve made a start, and will try
to get this continued throughout the year, so that I have a novel ready by NaNoGenMo 2018&hellip; On the positive side,
my Scheme programming is getting better, and I have loads of ideas about what to implement over the coming year.</p>
